It is one of the most popular Indic input technologies with more than a billion words typed on the website alone.\r\n\r\n   > Quillpad pioneered the successful use of machine learning for \r\n   > building a predictive language input technology. \r\n   > Quillpad has been rated as the best by many organisations that have embraced Quillpad.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n   1.0.1\r\n\r\n### Preparation\r\n\r\n   There are several archive files in the repository which have to be extracted, these include trained transliteration models and additional text files necessary for the Quillpad Server\r\n\r\n   *  CherryPy-3.2.2.tar.gz\r\n   *  EnglishPronouncingTrees.tar.bz2\r\n   *  IndianPronouncingTrees.tar.bz2\r\n   *  additional_text_files.zip\r\n   *  bengali.tar.bz2\r\n   *  gujarati.tar.bz2\r\n   *  hindi.tar.bz2\r\n   *  kannada.tar.bz2\r\n   *  malayalam.tar.bz2\r\n   *  marathi.tar.bz2\r\n   *  nepali.tar.bz2\r\n   *  punjabi.tar.bz2\r\n   *  tamil.tar.bz2\r\n   *  telugu.tar.bz2\r\n   *  unique_word_files.zip\r\n\r\n   **Kindly extract all of these archives into the repository folder itself.**\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n   Quillpad Server requires [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.\r\n\r\n   First, we need to compile the Quillpad Model loader that will be used to load the trained transliteration models\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   $ cd Python\\ Cart/python\r\n   $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace\r\n   $ cp QuillCCart.so ../../\r\n   $ cd ../../\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Now, the Quillpad Server is ready to run\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   $ python startquill_cherry.py\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   ### Additional Information\r\n\r\n   * Quillpad runs on port number 8090 (Additional configuration parameters are in *quill_cherry8088.conf*)\r\n\r\n   * *processWordJSON* and *processWord* are the API endpoints over which the transliteration server can be accessed.\r\n   > Example:\r\n\r\n      * localhost:8090/processWordJSON?inString=hello&lang=hindi\r\n      * localhost:8090/processWordJSON?inString=hello&lang=kannada",
