   ### Installation

   Quillpad Server requires [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

   First, we need to compile the Quillpad Model loader that will be used to load the trained transliteration models

   ```sh
   $ cd Python\ Cart/python
   $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
   $ cp QuillCCart.so ../../
   $ cd ../../
   ```

   Now, the Quillpad Server is ready to run

   ```sh
   $ python startquill_cherry.py
   ```

   ### Additional Information

   * Quillpad runs on port number 8090 (Additional configuration parameters are in *quill_cherry8088.conf*)

   * *processWordJSON* and *processWord* are the API endpoints over which the transliteration server can be accessed.
   > Example:

      * localhost:8090/processWordJSON?inString=hello&lang=hindi
      * localhost:8090/processWordJSON?inString=hello&lang=kannada

   ### Development

   Additional Quillpad Documentation coming soon. Thanks for your patience.
